This module contains the classes that are responsible for running the model and
calculate features of the model, both in parallel (``RunModel`` and
``Parallel``), as well as the class for performing the uncertainty calculations
(``UncertaintyCalculations``. It also contains the base classes that are
responsible for setting and updating parameters, models and features across
classes (``Base`` and ``ParameterBase``).
